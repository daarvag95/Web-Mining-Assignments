It's a way to generate software. So, it uses statistics but it's fundamentally... it's almost like a compiler. You use data to produce programs. -  in his \n\nSome even argue that \".\"\nFor more details, I'd recommend starting out with a fun intro to what's possible such as Peter Norvig's  talk, , or more recently the  (that I quoted from above).\nNext get your hands dirty with Jeremy Howard's \".\" It's a great pragmatic overview of actually working with data. \nOnce you've played around a bit, watch Ben Hamner's \"\" for a nice pragmatic disclaimer of what can easily go wrong when doing machine learning.\nI wrote a blog post \"\" after spending months trying to understand , the ML system that does matchmaking and ranking on Xbox Live. The post goes into some foundational statistics needed for further study in machine learning.\nPerhaps the best way to learn is to just try it. One approach is to try a  competition that sounds interesting to you. Even though I don't do great on the leaderboards there, I always learn things when I try a competition.\nAfter that you've done the above, I'd then recommend something more formal like Andrew Ng's . It's at the college level, but approachable. If you've done all the above steps, you'll be more motivated to not give up when you hit some harder things.\nAs you continue, you'll learn about things such as  and its , , , ,  , and  .\nDISCLAIMER: I work at Kaggle and several of the above links mention Kaggle, but I believe they're a fantastic place to start.\n", "comments": []}, {"text": "\nvideolectures.net has a large collection of \n.\nOne very good technical introductory lecture on the site is  by Sam Roweis.\nA good overview of the field is Tom Mitchell's seminar .
