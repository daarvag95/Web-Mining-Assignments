Basically it tries to move towards the local optimal solution by slowly moving down the curve.

Gradient descent is typically first order.", "Watch this lecture from start to finish: ", "Very similar, also with a good answer: "]}, "answers": [{"text": "\nAt a local minimum (or maximum) , the derivative of the target function  vanishes:  (assuming sufficient smoothness of ).\nGradient descent tries to find such a minimum  by using information from the first derivative of : It simply follows the steepest descent from the current point. This is like rolling a ball down the graph of  until it comes to rest (while neglecting inertia).\nNewton's method tries to find a point  satisfying  by approximating  with a linear function  and then solving for the root of that function explicitely (this is called Newton's root-finding method). The root of  is not necessarily the root of , but it is under many circumstances a good guess (the  has more information on convergence criteria). While approximating , Newton's method makes use of  (the curvature of ). This means it has higher requirements on the smoothness of , but it also means that (by using more information) it often converges faster.\n", "comments": ["I always see mentions of choosing the 'steepest descent'. What does that mean? Is that the most negative number of ?", "@Chowza: If your domain is multi-dimensional, e.g. if  maps 2D points to real numbers, then the gradient of  at any point is not a scalar number but a vector. The reason is that the \"steepness\" of  at that point depends on the direction that you're looking in. It's like standing on a mountain top: If you look north the mountain may drop off very sharply, but to the other sides it may be less steep. Choosing the steepest descent hence means choosing that direction which causes the greatest change in your target function."]}, {"text": "\nPut simply, gradient descent you just take a small step towards where you think the zero is and then recalculate; Newton's method, you go all the way there.\n", "comments": ["Is \"all the way\" true for a non-quadratic function?", "Yes, for non quadratic functions you are just approximating the first derivative with a line.  This is a bit hand wavey but I think it's fine for intuition.", "Ok, I agree. All the way to \"where you think the zero is\" is undoubtedly correct.", "If the main difference as you say is \"small steps\" vs \"all the way\", could you elaborate on how the size of the \"small step\" is determined?", "@MrPurple it's not very well defined, small enough that the gradient doesn't change too much (so you don't keep zigzagging) but large enough that you make progress.  A lot of research is around how to optimize this adaptively.  For intuition, think like on the order of .1% of the x value."]}, {"text": "\nEdit 2017: The original link is dead -\n but the way back machine still got it :) \nthis power point the main ideas are explained simply \nI hope this help :)\n", "comments": ["The link is down"]}, {"text": "\nIf you simply compare Gradient Descent and Newton's method, the purpose of the two methods are different.\nGradient Descent is used to find(approximate) local maxima or minima (x to make min f(x) or max f(x)). While Newton's method is to find(approximate) the root of a function, i.e. x to make f(x) = 0\nIn this sense, they are used to solve different problems. However, Newton's method can also be used in the context of optimization (the realm that GD is solving). Because finding maxima or minima can be approached by finding f'(x) = 0 which is exactly Newton's method is used for.\nIn conclusion, two methods can be used in optimization: 1)GD and 2)find x so f'(x)=0\nand Newton's method is just a way to solve that second problem.\n", "comments": []}]}
