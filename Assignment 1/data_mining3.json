Best regards, Kristaps", "@Kristaps: I think you are are right so far. But you don't necessarily find classes with clustering. It is more that you want to see whether some set of items form some kind of relationship (by being closer together in some model). You normally don't find classes (if you think that you use clustering to find classes for classification). That is not the case. Instead, you have a training set at the beginning which consist of labelled items (so you know which class they belong to). You then train a classification algorithm to assign the items to the right classes and you verify the", "correctness (which you can do, as the data is labelled). A daily example of classification would be spam filtering. The spam filter has to decide if a mail is spam or not. You can also tell the filter if a mail has been wrongly classified. For clustering, I don't really know an example. But you could e.g. take 1000 Twitter messages, try to clustering and then examine what (and if) relation the clusters expose.", "I think both Classification and Clustering are Classify method, it that right ?", "@MrROY If by Classify you mean: \"arrange (a group of people or things) in classes or categories according to shared qualities or characteristics.\" , then yes."]}, {"text": "\nPlease read the following information:\n\n\n\n", "comments": ["Clustering does not require to know the number of classes.", "@D1X True.

Airline example: coach, coach with early boarding, coach with extra leg room."]}, {"text": "\nI am sure a number of you have heard about machine learning. A dozen of you might even know what it is. And a couple of you might have worked with machine learning algorithms too. \nYou see where this is going? Not a lot of people are familiar with the technology that will be absolutely essential 5 years from now. Siri is machine learning. Amazon’s Alexa is machine learning. Ad and shopping item recommender systems are machine learning. \nLet’s try to understand machine learning with a simple analogy of a 2 year old boy. Just for fun, let’s call him Kylo Ren\n\nLet’s assume Kylo Ren saw an elephant. What will his brain tell him ?(Remember he has minimum thinking capacity, even if he is the successor to Vader). His brain will tell him that he saw a big moving creature which was grey in color. He sees a cat next, and his brain tells him that it is a small moving creature which is golden in color. Finally, he sees a light saber next and his brain tells him that it is a non-living object which he can play with!\nHis brain at this point knows that saber is different from the elephant and the cat, because the saber is something to play with and doesn’t move on its own. His brain can figure this much out even if Kylo doesn’t know what movable means. This simple phenomenon is called Clustering .\n\nMachine learning is nothing but the mathematical version of this process.\nA lot of people who study statistics realized that they can make some equations work in the same way as brain works. \nBrain can cluster similar objects, brain can learn from mistakes and brain can learn to identify things.\nAll of this can be represented with statistics, and the computer based simulation of this process is called Machine Learning. Why do we need the computer based simulation? because computers can do heavy math faster than human brains. \nI would love to go into the mathematical/statistical part of machine learning but you don’t wanna jump into that without clearing some concepts first.\nLet’s get back to Kylo Ren. Let’s say Kylo picks up the saber and starts playing with it. He accidentally hits a stormtrooper and the stormtrooper gets injured. He doesn’t understand what’s going on and continues playing. Next he hits a cat and the cat gets injured. This time Kylo is sure he has done something bad, and tries to be somewhat careful. But given his bad saber skills, he hits the elephant and is absolutely sure that he is in trouble. \nHe becomes extremely careful thereafter, and only hits his dad on purpose as we saw in Force Awakens!!\n\nThis entire process of learning from your mistake can be mimicked with equations, where the feeling of doing something wrong is represented by an error or cost. This process of identifying what not to do with a saber is called Classification . \nClustering and Classification are the absolute basics of machine learning. Let’s look at the difference between them.\nKylo differentiated between animals and light saber because his brain decided that light sabers cant move by themselves and are therefore, different. The decision was based solely upon the objects present (data) and no external help or advice was provided. \nIn contrast to this, Kylo differentiated the importance of being careful with light saber by first observing what hitting an object can do. The decision wasn’t completely based on the saber, but on what it could do to different objects . In short, there was some help here.\n\nBecause of this difference in learning, Clustering is called an unsupervised learning method and Classification is called a supervised learning method. \nThey are very different in the machine learning world, and are often dictated by the kind of data present. Obtaining labelled data (or things that help us learn , like stormtrooper,elephant and cat in Kylo’s case) is often not easy and becomes very complicated when the data to be differentiated is large. On the other hand, learning without labels can have it’s own disadvantages , like not knowing what are the label titles. \nIf Kylo was to learn being careful with the saber without any examples or help, he wouldn’t know what it would do. He would just know that it is not suppose to be done. It’s kind of a lame analogy but you get the point!\nWe are just getting started with Machine Learning. Classification itself can be classification of continuous numbers or classification of labels. For instance, if Kylo had to classify what each stormtrooper’s height is, there would be a lot of answers because the heights can be 5.0, 5.01, 5.011, etc. But a simple classification like types of light sabers (red,blue.green) would have very limited answers. Infact they can be represented with simple numbers. Red can be 0 , Blue can be 1 and Green can be 2.\nIf you know basic math, you know that 0,1,2 and 5.1,5.01,5.011 are different and are called discrete and continuous numbers respectively. The classification of discrete numbers is called Logistic Regression , and classification of continuous numbers is called Regression. \nLogistic Regression is also known as categorical classification, so don’t be confused when you read this term elsewhere\nThis was a very basic introduction to Machine Learning. I will dwell into the statistical side in my next post.

The difference between supervised learning and unsupervised learning can be found .\n", "comments": []}, {"text": "\nClassification\nIs the assignment of predefined classes to new observations, based on learning from examples.\nIt is one of the key tasks in machine learning.\nClustering (or Cluster Analysis)\nWhile popularly dismissed as \"unsupervised classification\" it is quite different.\nIn contrast to what many machine learners will teach you, it is not about assigning \"classes\" to objects, but without having them predefined. This is the very limited view of people who did too much classification; a typical example of if you have a hammer (classifier), everything looks like a nail (classification problem) to you. But it is also why classification people do not get a hang of clustering.\nInstead, consider it as structure discovery. The task of clustering is to find structure (e.g. groups) in your data that you did not know before. Clustering has been successful if you learned something new. It failed, if you only got the structure you already knew.\nCluster analysis is a key task of data mining (and the ugly duckling in machine-learning, so don't listen to machine learners dismissing clustering).\n\"Unsupervised learning\" is somewhat an Oxymoron\nThis has been iterated up and down the literature, but unsupervised learning is bllsht. It does not exist, but it is an oxymoron like \"military intelligence\".\nEither the algorithm learns from examples (then it is \"supervised learning\"), or it does not learn. If all the clustering methods are \"learning\", then computing the minimum, maximum and average of a data set is \"unsupervised learning\", too. Then any computation \"learned\" its output. Thus the term 'unsupervised learning' is totally meaningless, it means everything and nothing.\nSome \"unsupervised learning\" algorithms do, however, fall into the optimization category. For example k-means is a least-squares optimization. Such methods are all over statistics, so I don't think we need to label them \"unsupervised learning\", but instead should continue to call them \"optimization problems\". It's more precise, and more meaningful.\nThere are plenty of clustering algorithms who do not involve optimization, and who do not fit into machine-learning paradigms well. So stop squeezing them in there under the umbrella \"unsupervised learning\".\nThere is some \"learning\" associated with clustering, but it is not the program that learns. It is the user that is supposed to learn new things about his data set.\n", "comments": ["This answer made me realize that I was a classification person. It really helped me.", "Every clustering algorithm assumes a general meta model. Btw, the same goes for supervised learning, e.g. neural networks (NN). In both cased (supervised and unsupervised), we optimize the general meta model's parameters to fit the data according to a (sometimes hidden) cost function. (This part is called \"learning\".) This goes for both, clustering and classifcation. In both cases we learn a specific model (based on a assumed general meta model) via optimized according to the presented data. Using the specific optimized clustering model we are able to cluster the data into groups.", "TL;DR: You are right that clustering is not \"unsupervised classifcation\", but usupervised learning is not an oxymoron - learning is happening!", "Where is the \"learning\" in DBSCAN, for example?"]}, {"text": "\nBy clustering, you can group data with your desired properties such as the number, the shape, and other properties of extracted clusters. While, in classification, the number and the shape of groups are fixed.\nMost of the clustering algorithms give the number of clusters as a parameter. However, there are some approaches to find out the appropriate number of clusters.\n", "comments": []}, {"text": "\nFirst of all, like many answers state here: classification is supervised learning and clustering is unsupervised. This means:\n\nClassification needs labeled data so the classifiers can be trained on this data, and after that start classifying new unseen data based on what he knows. Unsupervised learning like clustering does not uses labeled data, and what it actually does is to discover intrinsic structures in the data like groups. \nAnother difference between both techniques (related to the previous one), is the fact that classification is a form of discrete regression problem where the output is a categorical dependent variable. Whereas clustering's output yields a set of subsets called groups. The way to evaluate these two models is also different for the same reason: in classification you often have to check for the precision and recall, things like overfitting and underfitting, etc. Those things will tell you how good is the model. But in clustering you usually need the vision of and expert to interpret what you find, because you don't know what type of structure you have (type of group or cluster). That's why clustering belongs to exploratory data analysis. \nFinally, i would say that applications are the main difference between both. Classification as the word says, is used to discriminate instances that belong to a class or another, for example a man or a woman, a cat or a dog, etc. Clustering is often used in the diagnosis of medical illness, discovery of patterns, etc. \n\n", "comments": []}, {"text": "\nClassification: Predict results in a discrete output => map input variables into discrete categories\n\nPopular use cases:\n\nEmail classification : Spam or non-Spam\nSanction loan to customer : Yes if he is capable of paying EMI for the sanctioned loan amount.

So, let's say you said to your friend that:\n\nPeople with long hair are Women.\nPeople with short hair are Men.\n\nQ2.  Now, you point out to a Person with long hair and ask your friend - Is it a Man or a Woman?\nThe only answer that you can expect is: Woman.\nOf course, there can be men with long hairs and women with short hairs in the party. But, the answer is correct based on the learning you provided to your friend. You can further improve the process by teaching more to your friend on how to differentiate between the two.\nIn above example,\nQ1 represents the task what Clustering achieves.\nIn Clustering you provide the data(people) to the algorithm(your friend) and ask it to group the data. \nNow, it's up to algorithm to decide what's the best way to group is? (Gender, Color or age group).\nAgain,you can definitely influence the decision made by the algorithm by providing extra inputs.\nQ2 represents the task Classification achieves.\nThere, you give your algorithm(your friend) some data(People), called as Training data, and made him learn which data corresponds to which label(Male or Female). Then you point your algorithm to certain data, called as Test data, and ask it to determine whether it is Male or Female. The better your teaching is, the better it's prediction.\nAnd the Pre-work in Q2 or Classification is nothing but just training your model so that it can learn how to differentiate.
