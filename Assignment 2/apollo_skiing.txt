This is not an optimal representation, but it is fine. The planar layout makes it suitable for detecting circles in the data and ensures that everything is recognizable and readable, but ideally one would use a more linear layout that makes it easier to recognize the start and end of the graph. Even though one can identify all neighbors, it is not easy to see that all paths start at Apollo and end at Skiing.
