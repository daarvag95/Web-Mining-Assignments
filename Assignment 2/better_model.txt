The Scores obtained were:
AIC for order 1: 367691.0240090471
BIC for order 1: 1592035.710648168
AIC for order 2: 143308856.87445766
BIC for order 2: 651414844.9659588
So according to the obtained scores the order 1 models are better since their scores are lower. 
This might be because the scores also take a penalty into account for the (estimated) number of parameters.
